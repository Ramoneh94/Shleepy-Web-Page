# Shleepy-Web-Page
Sleep app with landing page in HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
with sleep noise app with different sleep sounds (made in Vanilla JS). sounds can be played simultaneuosly to simulate a soothing environment. 

I made and designed the Ux/UI and illustrations using Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop and used vanilla Javascript to create a website for a product (ideally a finished mobile application with React Native) that would be a collection of pleasing sounds that would allow for better sleep. There is a working demo of the page in sounds.html/sounds.css. 

thanks to u/wambojambo on reddit and r/javascript on reddit for the help!
