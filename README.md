# Shleepy-Web-Page
Website for Shleepy app with Demo

I made the branding and illustration using Adobe Illustrator and used vanilla Javascript to create a website for a product (ideally a finished mobile application) that would be a collection of pleasing sounds that would allow for better sleep. There is a working demo of the page in sounds.html/sounds.css. 

thanks to u/wambojambo on reddit and r/javascript on reddit for the help!
